# Yet Another Simple Shell

This is a simple shell implementation that I implemented during my studies.
You can:
  * run a command with appropriate command line arguments (PATH environment variable is accepted)
  * run a background job using &
  * stdout and stdin redirection using < >

The application is POSIX compliant and uses two threads (one for reading input
and another one for executing processes). Obtained 10/10 points.

Use on your own risk!
